# Randomized-smoothing-example
This is a computer vision example for running a randomized smoothing algorithm on CIFAR-10 dataset 
This is a Python implementation of Randomized Smoothing applied to a computer vision example using PyTorch and ResNet-18 on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
The code applies Gaussian noise to the input images and uses majority voting to determine the final classification.

*The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.*
*ResNet-18 is a convolutional neural network that is 18 layers deep. The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals. As a result, the network has learned rich feature representations for a wide range of images. The network has an image input size of 224-by-224*
